# Asynchronous

Too flexible, unopinionated, mono threading, OOP or non OOP, too wild style...

JS is strong but easy to have unexpected errors, should pay attention to take advantage of its power and learn advanced skills to conquer its weakness

Asynchronous programming is the beauty of JS, in Java it's a waste of memory when a program tries to handle multiple threads/requests (of a server) at the same time
