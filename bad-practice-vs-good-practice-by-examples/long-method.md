  to maintain, hard to understand

# Long method

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Java" %}
```java
// It's obvious so there is no example. Generally, long methods would create a lot of bad consequences a long with the development of the project so it's highly recommended to avoid
```
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="TypeScript" %}
```java
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="success" %}
If you feel the need to comment on something inside a method, take this code and put it in a new method
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Even a single line can and should be split off into a separate method
{% endhint %}
